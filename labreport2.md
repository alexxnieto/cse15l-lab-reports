The handlerequest method is called as well as the main method under the main class StringServer.\

The relevant arguments would be the  "/add-message?s=Hello" because the handlerequest method using this to determine what to add to the empty string and determining that it's a query that needs to be implemented.

No values got changed as the code doesn't affect the type of the fields in the class, unless you would consider the empty string I established at the beginning to be updated but then the information is removed with eahc new query or search. 




***PART 2: REVERSE IN PLACE METHOD***

A failure inducing argument would be: '[1,2,3]'

'@Test
  public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1},input1);'

***PART 3: LEARNING***
Something I learned this week in lab was how to use J-Unit tests. 
I learned how to format a J-Unit test and how to write tests to make sure I can debug my code properly. 
This is extremely helpful because it shows a different way to debug code.  
I also learned the difference between these j-unit tests than the tests we wrote in cse 8b class.
