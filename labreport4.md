Step 1: Logging into ieng6

![Image](img40.png)

They keys I pressed in order were: `ssh`, < SPACE > , `cs15lsp23cy`, < SHIFT 2 > , `ucsd.edu`, < ENTER >.

I then entered my password, which I will not discuss the keys I pressed for OBVIOUS reasons. 

With these keys and steps I am able to log into my ieng6 account where I can then clone the repository. 

Step 2: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account



The keys I pressed in order were: `git`, < SPACE > , `clone`, < SPACE >, < CTRL V >, < ENTER >.

With these keys, I am able to clone the link, which in turn let me have the file lab7 on my computer, which contains the two java files I need. 

I used < CTRL V > above because I had already had the link copied to my clipboard beforehand. 

Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

The keys I pressed in order were: `cd`, < SPACE >, `lab7`, < ENTER >, < up >, < up >, < up >, < ENTER >, < up >, < up >, < ENTER >.
